# Digital_Lab_SPI

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocols and related digital logic designs written in VHDL. The project is intended to demonstrate and provide resources for the development and simulation of SPI protocols, which are widely used in embedded systems for communication between microcontrollers and peripherals.

## Features
- Implementation of SPI Master and Slave modules.
- Configurable clock speed and data transfer settings.
- Support for common SPI modes (CPOL and CPHA).
- Testbench for simulation and verification of SPI functionality.
- Modular and reusable VHDL code for digital designs.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A VHDL-compatible simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or GHDL).
- Basic understanding of SPI protocols and digital design in VHDL.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Revanth-144/Digital_Lab_SPI.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your VHDL simulator.
3. Compile the `src` files and `testbench` files.
4. Run the simulation to observe the SPI protocol in action.

## Applications
- Learning and practicing SPI protocol design in VHDL.
- Testing and verifying SPI communication in embedded systems.
- Reusing the modules in other digital design projects.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvement or additional features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
